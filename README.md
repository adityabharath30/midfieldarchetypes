Data Driven Clustering Of Football Midfielder Types

The purpose of this research is to develop a new method of viewing and classifying football midfielders. The classification is based on a collection of 33 various numeric predictors comprising offensive, defensive, possession, and other metrics collected by StatBombâ€™s online database for the 2021-22 season across the Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Premier League. A machine learning clustering model (K Means) was used to cluster the players into groups based on their similarities. Principal Component Analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to its essential features. A classification model was then built to be able to effectively classify a player into one of the newly determined midfield classes. The past 5 years UEFA Champions League winning teams and their respective midfield trios were examined and classified them using the model.
